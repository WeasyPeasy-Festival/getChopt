# Hello Festival Gamers!

### This is a self-made website to get the overdrive path of Fortnite Festival songs faster!

## How to use:
### 1) Enter your song

How to format the song: all lowercase letters, no spaces, no special characters, type out numbers to text (e.g: 8-Bit Beat --> eightbitbeat). UPDATE! I checked and some songs need numbers in text but some don't. "Song 2" is fine with "song2" but 24K Magic needs twentyfourkmagic. Check \
Some songs do not need to have the full songname typed out to get the right result (e.g: All Of Me (TiÃ«sto's Birthday Treatment Remix) --> allofme).\
If you still do not find a song consider visiting the [gmscorner website]([url](https://www.gmscorner.dev/fortnite/expert/guitar/)) to get the right format.\
Songs with the same name will be sorted by release date (released earlier: dynamite, released later: dynamite2)\
### 2) Select instrument
### 3) Select difficulty
### 4) Select squeeze percent 
(explanation: Squeezing is the practice of using overdrive to activate your notes later to get more notes under your overdrive phrase. The higher the % the harder it is to use squeezing. For beginners I recommend 0% squeeze).
### 5) Press the "Get Chopt" button 
If this doesn't take you to a valid overdrive path the song format is wrong or the song doesn't exist _yet_.


### I hope that this little website will make the accessability of highscores easier!
